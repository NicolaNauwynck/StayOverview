Look up a vessel's (stay) information in APCS;

| This documentation applies to v1.0 of this API |

## Purpose of this API

**APCS (Antwerp Port Community System)** hosts a web page that, based on a ship's name or IMO number, provides some general information about the ship and a list of its recent (i.e. last 2 months) and upcoming stays.

This functionality on the APCS website is heavily used, but involves manually entering name or IMO number into the web page.

NxtPort is collaborating with APCS on offering the same functionality as an API on the NxtPort Platform. Allowing applications to get the information from an API means no more manual entry or copy-pasting.
